# FileFlow - File Conversion Tools

## Overview

FileFlow is a comprehensive client-side file conversion web application with a premium Apple/Notion-inspired design. The platform features a universal converter with live file previews, drag-and-drop functionality, and advanced options for all conversion tools. It includes multiple specialized tool sections: Image Tools (HEIC to JPG, JPG to PNG), PDF Tools (merge, split, compress, rotate, watermark, PDF to Word), and Media Tools (MP4 to MP3, video compression, audio conversion, video trimming, GIF creation, video merging). Built with vanilla JavaScript and modern web technologies, all conversions happen client-side for maximum privacy and speed.
