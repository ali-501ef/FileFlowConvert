# FileFlow - File Conversion Tools

## Recent Changes
- **Mobile Navigation System Implemented (Aug 2025)**: Created comprehensive mobile navigation with sliding sidebar menu, touch-friendly controls, and smooth animations. Features include: collapsible hamburger menu with rotation animation, glassmorphism design with backdrop blur, organized tool sections with visual indicators, proper touch targets (44px minimum), and body scroll prevention when menu is open. Navigation automatically closes on link selection and supports keyboard accessibility (ESC key).
- **Completed Audio/Video Tools Rebuild (Jan 2025)**: Successfully rebuilt all 6 Audio/Video tools (MP4â†’MP3, Audio Converter, Video Compress, Video Merger, Video Trim, GIF Maker) from scratch using the PDF Compress pattern. All tools now use shared components (FileUploader, ProgressTracker, ButtonLoader, ErrorDisplay, FileUtils, AnalyticsTracker), server-side processing via /api/convert-media, and consistent UI structure. This completes the comprehensive tool rebuild project.
- **Fixed Cross-Tool Reliability Issues (Jan 2025)**: Resolved inline onclick handler conflicts in PDF Merge and Video Compress tools that were causing double file picker opening. Applied unified upload pattern from working PDF Compress/Split reference implementations across all 8 broken tools. All tools now use clean JavaScript addEventListener patterns without conflicting inline handlers.

## Overview
FileFlow is a comprehensive client-side file conversion web application with a premium Apple/Notion-inspired design. It features a universal converter with live file previews, drag-and-drop functionality, and advanced options. The platform includes specialized tool sections for Image Tools (HEIC to JPG, JPG to PNG), PDF Tools (merge, split, compress, rotate, watermark, PDF to Word), and Media Tools (MP4 to MP3, video compression, audio conversion, video trimming, GIF creation, video merging). All conversions happen client-side for maximum privacy and speed, built with vanilla JavaScript and modern web technologies.
