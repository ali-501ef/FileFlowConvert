Final SEO Fixes (STRICT SCOPE)

Scope: Edit only the listed files and the <head> sections.
Do not change layout, styles, tool logic, routes, or shared components.

1) Fix wrong canonicals

Update <link rel="canonical"> to the production domain https://fileflow.replit.app:

client/image-tools/more.html

client/pdf-merge-old.html → also mark as noindex (see §4)

<link rel="canonical" href="https://fileflow.replit.app/<correct-route>" />

2) Add missing SEO tags on legal pages

Add the following to both:

client/privacy-policy.html

client/terms-of-use.html

<!-- Canonical -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://fileflow.replit.app/privacy-policy.html" />
<!-- or terms-of-use.html on the ToS page -->

<!-- Open Graph -->
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:title" content="FileFlow – Privacy Policy" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Learn how FileFlow collects, uses, and protects your data. We outline the types of information we process and the rights you have over your information." />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://fileflow.replit.app/privacy-policy.html" />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://fileflow.replit.app/og/default.png" />

<!-- Twitter -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="twitter:title" content="FileFlow – Privacy Policy" />
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Learn how FileFlow collects, uses, and protects your data, including your choices and rights." />
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://fileflow.replit.app/og/default.png" />


Adjust titles/URLs accordingly on terms-of-use.html.

3) Replace too‑short meta descriptions (80–170 chars)

Update <meta name="description"> on these pages with the exact text below (all 110–160 chars). Only replace the description content; keep titles/canonicals as-is.

(If any of these pages already pass length, leave them unchanged.)

4) Exclude templates/old pages from indexing (no layout changes)

For files not meant to be indexed:

client/js/nav-template.html

client/pdf-merge-old.html (legacy)

Add inside <head>:

<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />
<link rel="canonical" href="https://fileflow.replit.app/" />


And ensure they are not in sitemap.xml.

5) Re‑run the audit script and share proof

Run the same commands we used:

node scripts/seo-audit.mjs

# Canonicals and endpoints
grep -oE '<link[^>]+rel="canonical"[^>]*>' client/**/*.html
for p in "/" "/sitemap.xml" "/robots.txt"; do
  echo "$p -> $(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://localhost:5000$p")"
done
