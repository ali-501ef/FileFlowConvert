Command: Fix results panel placement & behavior (all tools)

Problem: On several pages (e.g., PDF Compress, PDF Split, PDF Rotate, PDF to Word, PDF Watermark, MP4 to MP3, Audio Converter, Video Compress, GIF Maker, Video Trim, Video Merger) the results/download panel renders below informational sections (“Why …”), pushing it out of view.

Goal: For every tool page, the results panel must appear immediately under the upload area / primary action button and above any explanatory/SEO sections. Keep current styling; only fix structure/placement/visibility.

Do:

DOM placement

Ensure each page has a single results container (e.g., #resultPanel or page-specific equivalent).

Programmatically insert (or render) this container right after the main upload widget wrapper (dropzone) and before the informational section.

Do not duplicate nodes; reuse the same container per page.

Visibility & lifecycle

Results container is hidden by default.

After a successful job, populate, show, and scroll into view (smooth).

On new file selection/start of a new job, clear previous results and hide until the new job completes.

Consistency

Use the same markup blocks and classes for: summary stats (size before/after, reduction), per-file links (where applicable), and main Download button.

Respect ad slots and page gutters; do not move or overlap existing ad placeholders.

Responsive

Ensure the results container width follows the main content container.

Cards/rows wrap cleanly on small viewports; no horizontal scroll.

Regression guard

Do not change copy, colors, or SEO sections—only move the results container.

Keep IDs/classes stable so existing CSS applies.

Acceptance criteria (for each page above):

After conversion, the results/download panel shows right under the uploader/action button without needing to scroll past “Why …” text.

Starting a new job hides the old results until the new job finishes.

No duplicate results blocks; no layout shift of ad spaces.

Mobile/desktop both render cleanly.

Please implement and confirm with short before/after screenshots for at least:

PDF Compress, PDF Split, Video Compress, and GIF Maker.
