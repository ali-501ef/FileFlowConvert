The Universal to JPEG tool is currently broken and not functioning at all. Please address this with urgency:

❌ Current Issues:
Uploading any file (HEIC, JPEG, PNG, etc.) does not trigger conversion.

The tool either:

Redirects users unnecessarily, or

Returns an error without explanation.

No file types tested work successfully — not even JPEG or PNG.

The "Convert Now" button appears functional visually but triggers no valid response from the backend or shows user feedback.

✅ Required Fixes:
Fix the file upload handler — Ensure all supported file types (HEIC, JPG, PNG, PDF, WEBP) are properly processed.

Ensure backend routes are connected — The /api/convert or equivalent route must:

Accept the file

Detect its type

Trigger the conversion logic without redirecting the user unnecessarily.

Implement proper error handling and user feedback:

If the file is unsupported, show a friendly message.

If conversion fails, return a proper in-browser error with suggested next steps.

Test conversion end-to-end:

Drag and drop → file processed → user sees confirmation → download button works.

Please confirm once this tool is fully functional and conversion works without redirecting the user.

No, not the univseal to JPG, but that as well, but the main conversion tool at the top of the sites homepage, that accepts any file and converts them to a range of formats

Thank you — here's the corrected command for Replit, clearly referring to the main file converter tool at the top of the homepage (not the "Universal to JPEG" tool):

⚠️ Replit Command (Main Homepage File Converter – Critical Fix Needed)
The main file converter on the homepage (top section) is completely broken and does not work with any file format. This issue is urgent and must be fixed immediately.

❌ Current Issues:
The tool says “Convert Files Instantly” but does not perform any conversion at all.

Uploading any file (HEIC, JPG, PNG, PDF, etc.) either:

Redirects the user unnecessarily, or

Returns an unexplained error.

The "Convert Now" button does not function correctly — it appears to do something but fails silently or causes a page reload.

There is no error feedback shown to the user, which worsens the experience.

✅ Required Fixes:
Fix the core upload + conversion pipeline for this tool:

The drag/drop and “Choose File” functions should properly hand the file to the backend.

Backend must detect the filetype and convert it to the selected target format.

Ensure the dropdown (“Convert to…”) and the “Convert Now” button are correctly linked to the conversion logic.

Return a converted file on success, not a redirect or empty action.

Add proper user feedback:

Progress/loading indicator during conversion.

Clear error message if file type is unsupported or conversion fails.
