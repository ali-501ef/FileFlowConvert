Please address the following critical functional and design issues across all PDF tools. These are essential to provide a professional user experience and bring FileFlow to a deployable, premium-ready state.

üîß PDF Merge Tool
Drag-to-reorder is broken: The interface allows hover but doesn't let files be dropped in a new position. This must be fixed for a seamless experience.

Advanced Options completely non-functional: The toggle does not open, and there is either no content inside or the settings have no effect. For example, setting orientation to landscape does nothing.
Fix this immediately and ensure it contains useful, working controls such as:

Output file orientation

Page margins

Merge order (e.g., by filename or manual)

Replace ‚ÄúPage Range‚Äù option with a better, intuitive advanced setting.

Ensure Advanced Options can be opened even before files are uploaded, shown under a clean toggle UI.

üß© PDF Split Tool
Core function fails: While it visually splits pages, the Download buttons do nothing‚Äîusers cannot get the output.

Advanced Options toggle is broken and shows nothing.
Fix the toggle and ensure it contains real, working features such as:

Page range selectors

Output naming format (e.g., file_p1.pdf)

Make options visible even without files uploaded.

üìâ PDF Compress Tool
Compression is fake: Files say ‚Äú25% reduced‚Äù but download with the exact same size as before. The compression engine must actually optimize file size.

Advanced Options toggle is broken and empty.
Provide real compression settings including:

Compression level (Low / Medium / High)

Remove metadata

Image quality control

Flattening scanned layers (OCR-based)

üìÑ PDF to Word Tool
Main conversion works, but:

Advanced Options toggle is broken and contains nothing.

The settings listed (e.g. preserve formatting, OCR recognition) do not apply.

Implement real functionality behind those options, with tooltips or helper text for clarity.

üîÑ PDF Rotate Tool
Page rotation functions, but:

Advanced Options are non-functional‚Äîtoggle does not open and no real settings are provided.

Add useful options like:

Auto-orient by content

Batch vs individual rotation

Preview of rotated output

üíß PDF Watermark Tool
Watermarks are not permanent: Current system adds a removable overlay. This is not secure and defeats the purpose of watermarking.

Implement true embedded watermarks that cannot be deleted from the final PDF.

Live preview needed: Let users see watermark position, opacity, and scale before confirming.

Advanced Options toggle does not open and is empty.
Populate it with real, working settings like:

Watermark layering (behind/above)

Position presets

Rotation angle

Opacity slider

Repeat/tile pattern toggle

üîÑ Site-wide & Shared Issues
Advanced Options are broken across all tools:

Toggles do not open or show empty panels

Even if visible, the features do not function

These must be fixed urgently, with real, functional options implemented under clear toggle sections.

Allow all Advanced Options to be accessible even before uploading files.
