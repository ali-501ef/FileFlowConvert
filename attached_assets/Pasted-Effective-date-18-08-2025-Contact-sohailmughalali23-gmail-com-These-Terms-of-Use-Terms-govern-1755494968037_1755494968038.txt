These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of FileFlow’s website and file-conversion tools (“Service”). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

1) Who we are

FileFlow (“we”, “us”, “our”) provides online tools to convert and edit files. We operate globally and can be reached at the contact email above.

2) Using FileFlow
	•	No account required. You may use the Service without registering.
	•	Age. The Service is intended for users aged 13 or older.
	•	Client-side vs. server-side. Some tools run entirely in your browser (files never leave your device). Others require upload to our servers hosted on Render to process and return results. Where relevant, tools may indicate which mode they use.

3) Your content and license to us
	•	You own your files. You retain all rights to files you upload and to outputs generated for you.
	•	Limited license. You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive license to host, process, and transmit your content solely to provide the Service and to meet legal/safety obligations. This license ends when processing is complete and our retention period expires.

4) File handling and deletion
	•	Client-side tools: files are processed locally in your browser; nothing is uploaded to us.
	•	Server-side tools: uploaded originals and generated outputs are stored up to 24 hours and then automatically deleted. We may delete earlier after successful download or upon request.
	•	Logs/metadata: non-content operational data (e.g., job IDs, timestamps, file type/size) may be retained for 7 days for troubleshooting; security/operational logs without file contents may be retained for 30 days.
You are responsible for downloading results before deletion.

5) Acceptable Use Policy

You agree not to use the Service to:
	•	Violate the law or others’ rights, including copyright, trademark, privacy, or publicity rights.
	•	Upload malicious code, attempt to bypass security, probe or overload our systems, or scrape without permission.
	•	Upload or generate unlawful, exploitative, or abusive content (including child sexual abuse material).
	•	Circumvent rate limits or use automated means not provided by us to access the Service.
We may remove content, suspend, or terminate access to protect users, comply with law, or ensure service integrity.

6) Advertising and third-party services
	•	Advertising. We display advertising via Google AdSense. Google and its partners may use cookies and similar technologies to deliver, measure, and personalise ads. In the EEA/UK/Switzerland we seek consent; if you decline, we serve non-personalised ads.
	•	Consent controls. You can manage choices via the site’s cookie preferences.
	•	Third parties. The Service may link to or rely on third parties (e.g., Render for hosting, Google for ads). Those services are governed by their own terms and policies; we are not responsible for them.

7) Privacy

Your use of the Service is also governed by the FileFlow Privacy Policy (effective 18/08/2025). It explains what we collect, how we use it, retention periods, your rights, and cookie/ads information.

8) Intellectual property

The FileFlow site, software, and trademarks are our intellectual property or that of our licensors. These Terms do not grant you rights to our branding, code, or look-and-feel.

9) Feedback

If you choose to provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use that feedback without obligation to you.

10) Availability and changes

The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We may change, suspend, or discontinue features at any time. We may apply limits (e.g., file size, rate limits) to maintain performance and security.

11) Disclaimers

File conversion, compression, or editing can alter quality, metadata, or formatting. You are responsible for keeping backups and validating outputs for your use case. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

12) Limitation of liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, FileFlow and its owners will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for loss of data, profits, or goodwill. Our total liability for all claims in any 12-month period is limited to £100 or the amount you paid us in that period, whichever is greater.

13) Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your content or your breach of these Terms or the Acceptable Use Policy.

14) Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access immediately if you breach these Terms, if required by law, or to protect users or the Service.

15) Governing law and venue

These Terms are governed by the laws of Northern Ireland. The courts of Northern Ireland (sitting in Belfast) have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes, except where consumer law grants you mandatory local rights.

16) Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. We will change the Effective date above and, where changes are material, provide a notice on the site. Your continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.

17) Severability and entire agreement

If any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining sections remain in effect. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, are the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service.
