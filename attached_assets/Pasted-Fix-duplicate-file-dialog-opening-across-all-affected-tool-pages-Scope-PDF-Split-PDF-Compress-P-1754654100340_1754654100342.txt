Fix duplicate file dialog opening across all affected tool pages.

Scope: PDF Split, PDF Compress, PDF Rotate, PDF Watermark, PDF to Word, MP4 to MP3, Audio Converter, Video Compress, GIF Maker, Video Trim, Video Merger.

Root cause: The file input element (`<input type="file">`) is having its `click()` or `change` handler bound twice — once via HTML attributes and once via JavaScript event listeners. This results in the "Choose File" dialog appearing twice in succession (including after pressing Cancel).

Steps:
1. Audit each of the above tool pages’ JavaScript and HTML:
   - Remove any duplicate `onclick` attributes if the event is also bound via JS.
   - Ensure `input[type="file"]` handlers are only bound once. Use `element.removeEventListener()` before adding new listeners in any re-render/mount function.
   - If using delegated events, ensure they’re scoped so they’re not binding multiple times when navigating between tools.

2. Standardize file input handling:
   - Create a single `bindFileInputHandler(fileInput, callback)` function in a shared `fileInput.js` module.
   - Import and call it in each tool’s page init function.
   - Inside, check `if (fileInput.dataset.bound === "true") return;` before binding.
   - After binding, set `fileInput.dataset.bound = "true"`.

3. Verify Cancel behaviour:
   - Pressing Cancel must close the dialog without reopening it.
   - Selecting a file must trigger exactly one `change` event and upload it once.

4. Regression test:
   - On each affected page, click "Choose File" → Cancel (dialog should not reappear).
   - Click "Choose File" → pick a file (dialog should open once and upload immediately).
   - Repeat after navigating between tools — no duplicate opening should occur.

5. Apply the fix globally:
   - Update any shared modal/uploader components to include the dataset-bound guard.
   - Remove legacy inline event handlers from HTML where redundant.

Acceptance criteria:
- On all listed pages, clicking "Choose File" triggers one dialog instance only.
- Cancel does not reopen the dialog.
- File upload happens exactly once per selection.
- No other file input functionality is broken.
